# Machine learning models

Create 6 machine learning models, pick the best and build confidence that the accuracy is reliable.

## Steps:

We have already performed below steps in explore_dataset project:

1. Loading the dataset.
2. Summarizing the dataset.
3. Visualizing the dataset.

So now we will build machine learning models by applying below steps:

4. Evaluating some algorithms.
5. Making some predictions.


## Packages

- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- sklearn
